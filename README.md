Chocolate House - A Simple Web Application

This project is a basic web application simulating a chocolate house, built using HTML, CSS, Python, and SQLite. It allows users to browse a selection of chocolates, view product details, and potentially make purchases (though not implemented in this basic version).

Key Features:

Product Catalog: A simple HTML page displaying a list of chocolates with basic details like name, price, and image.
Product Details: Clicking on a product takes the user to a detailed page with more information.

User Interface: A clean and intuitive user interface designed using HTML and CSS.
How to Run:
